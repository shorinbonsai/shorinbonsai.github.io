My name is James Sargant and I am a Software Engineer at the beginning of a second career. I've recently completed my Master's degree in Computer Science where I studied AI, Machine Learning and evolutionary algorithms in their application to the simulation of Epidemics and the optimization of mitigation measures.

I am passionate about evolutionary algorithms and programming languages, and have attained some level of competence in Rust, Java, Python, Go and C++. Rust, Python and C++ were all used during my research. Python used for prototyping and in the processing of vast amounts of accumulated data, while Rust and C++ did the heavy lifting in generating all that data, and running the simulations.

I'm setting out now in a new direction after my education, and I look forward to finding where this new path takes me, though I'm realizing that my learning never really ends.
